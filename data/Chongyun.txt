### Substat Priorities:
CRIT Rate, CRIT DMG > Elemental Mastery, Energy Recharge > ATK%

### Skill Leveling Priority:
- **Prioritize Elemental Burst (Spirit Blade: Cloud-Parting Star)**
- **Avoid leveling Normal Attacks and Elemental Skill unless necessary**

**Reasoning:** Chongyun’s main damage comes from his Elemental Burst, particularly in Melt teams. His Elemental Skill is primarily for Cryo infusion rather than damage, making it less important to level up.

**Not Recommended Weapons:**
- **4★ Snow-Tombed Starsilver** (Physical DMG bonus is wasted due to Chongyun’s Cryo infusion removing Physical DMG potential.)
