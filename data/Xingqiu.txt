**Recommended Artifact Sets**

- **Solo Hydro Support**
- **Energy Recharge Focus**
- **Bloom Teams**

**Artifact Set Recommendations:**  
- **Full Set:** 4-piece Emblem of Severed Fate or 4-piece Noblesse Oblige + any other piece.
- **Mixed Sets:** 2-piece Noblesse Oblige + 2-piece Heart of Depth + 2-piece Nymph's Dream + any other piece.

**Reasoning:**
This setup suits Xingqiu when at least two of the following conditions apply: he is not at full constellation, is the only Hydro character in the team, or lacks a stable energy source from teammates. As a sub-DPS, Xingqiu primarily relies on his Elemental Burst, "Guhua Sword: Raincutter," for consistent off-field Hydro application. The 4-piece Emblem of Severed Fate is ideal as it boosts Energy Recharge and Elemental Burst damage. The 2-piece Noblesse Oblige increases sword rain damage, while the 2-piece Heart of Depth boosts Hydro damage and enhances the damage reduction from Rain Swords. In attack-heavy teams, when no other character is using the 4-piece Noblesse Oblige set (e.g., teams featuring Hu Tao, Zhongli, and Xingqiu), he can equip it to benefit teammates with its team-wide ATK boost.

**Main Stats:**  
- **Sands:** Energy Recharge% or ATK%
- **Goblet:** Hydro DMG Bonus
- **Circlet:** CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG

**Sub Stats Priority:**  
Energy Recharge (until comfortable) ≥ CRIT Rate / CRIT DMG > ATK%

**Recommended Weapons:**  
- **Best Weapon:** 4-star Sacrificial Sword
- **Alternative Weapons:** 4-star Favonius Sword, 4-star Amenoma Kageuchi

**Weapon Choice Explanation:**  
- **Sacrificial Sword** (Recommended at Refinement Rank 3 or higher) significantly reduces Xingqiu’s Energy Recharge needs, allowing smooth Elemental Burst uptime.
- **Favonius Sword** provides Energy Recharge and generates extra energy particles when Xingqiu lands critical hits.
- **Amenoma Kageuchi** at Refinement Rank 5 helps regenerate Energy upon using Elemental Burst, making it a budget alternative.

**Skill Priority:**  
Elemental Burst > Elemental Skill (Do not level Normal Attack)

**Leveling Recommendation:**
- Xingqiu’s Elemental Burst is his primary source of Hydro application and off-field damage, making it the top priority.
- His Elemental Skill not only provides damage reduction but also generates energy, making it valuable to level, especially with his 4th Constellation unlocked.
