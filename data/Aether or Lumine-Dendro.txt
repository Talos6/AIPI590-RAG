### **Note:**
In "Sumeru Archon Quest, Chapter 3, Act 1 - The Coming of the Sabzeruz Festival," the player must use "One-Handed Sword Combat Technique No. 8" according to the storyline. At this time, only the Traveler's base attack (white number) permanently increases by 3 points. If you have already completed this part of the quest, remember to include this additional 3 base attack points when calculating stats. Additionally, this stat has the following characteristics:
- It is directly added to the Traveler's panel and included in the "Final Attack Calculation Formula" under "Character Attack."
- This 3-point base attack bonus is not affected by the Traveler's level, meaning it applies at any level.
- This bonus remains effective even when switching the Traveler's current element.

### **Recommended Builds**

#### **Dendro Sub-DPS**

**Artifacts:**
- 4-piece Deepwood Memories
- 4-piece Gilded Dreams
- 4-piece Emblem of Severed Fate
- 4-piece Noblesse Oblige
- 2-piece Deepwood Memories + 2-piece Gladiator’s Finale
- 2-piece Noblesse Oblige + 2-piece Wanderer’s Troupe

**Artifact Set Justification:**
The Dendro Traveler functions as a Dendro applier and Sub-DPS in various teams, whether for Aggravate, Bloom, or Burgeon compositions. The 4-piece Deepwood Memories set reduces enemy Dendro resistance, which is beneficial when triggering Dendro-related reactions. However, if another character in the team is already using Deepwood Memories (e.g., Nahida), the Traveler does not need to equip it.

The 4-piece Gilded Dreams set provides Elemental Mastery and ATK bonuses but is less effective in Bloom teams, where Elemental Mastery mainly benefits Hydro characters triggering Bloom reactions. The 4-piece Emblem of Severed Fate provides Energy Recharge and scales Burst DMG, which is useful given the Traveler’s reliance on their Elemental Burst.

#### **General Elemental Build**

**Weapons:**
- Favonius Sword (Energy Recharge, generates particles for the team)
- Sacrificial Sword (Chance to reset Elemental Skill cooldown)
- Iron Sting (Boosts Elemental Mastery)

**Playstyle:**
- Use Razorgrass Blade to apply Dendro and generate energy.
- Deploy the Lea Lotus Lamp to maintain Dendro application and trigger Elemental Reactions.
- Switch to other characters to maximize reaction-based damage output.
