Xinyan excels in providing shields and reducing enemies’ Physical Resistance while also being capable of burst damage when properly built. At C6, she can become a viable main DPS with a heavy focus on Charged Attacks. However, her shield strength is relatively low compared to other shielders, making her best suited for hybrid support roles rather than pure defense.
