### **Recommended Builds**

#### **Healing Support (Below C6)**

- **Artifact Sets**: 4-piece Viridescent Venerer + Any piece, or 4-piece Noblesse Oblige + Any piece.
- **Set Recommendation**: This build focuses on supporting the team. The 4-piece Viridescent Venerer is optimal for Anemo support, reducing elemental resistance through Swirl. Noblesse Oblige offers a team-wide ATK% boost. Generally, Viridescent Venerer is better due to resistance shred.
- **Main Stat Recommendation**:
  - Sands: Energy Recharge or ATK%
  - Goblet: ATK%
  - Circlet: Healing Bonus
- **Substat Recommendation**: Energy Recharge > ATK% > Elemental Mastery
- **Reasoning**: Sayu's healing scales with ATK. Around 220% Energy Recharge is ideal with Favonius, Sacrificial, or Katsuragikiri Nagamasa, while ~260% is needed for other weapons.

#### **Full Elemental Mastery Build (C6)**

- **Artifact Sets**: 4-piece Viridescent Venerer or 4-piece Gilded Dreams
- **Set Recommendation**: At C6, Sayu’s Elemental Mastery significantly boosts her healing and Swirl damage, making 4-piece Viridescent Venerer ideal. If resistance shred isn't required, 4-piece Gilded Dreams provides additional EM and ATK.
- **Main Stat Recommendation**:
  - Sands: Elemental Mastery
  - Goblet: Elemental Mastery
  - Circlet: Elemental Mastery or Healing Bonus
- **Substat Recommendation**: Elemental Mastery > Energy Recharge > ATK%
- **Reasoning**: C6 Sayu benefits greatly from Elemental Mastery, enhancing both Swirl damage and healing.

#### **Recommended Weapons**

| Weapon | Rarity | Reason |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Wolf's Gravestone | 5★ | High base ATK and ATK% boost, greatly increasing Sayu’s healing. Provides team-wide ATK boost. |
| Favonius Greatsword | 4★ | High Energy Recharge, generates particles for the team. Requires Crit Rate substats to proc. |
| Katsuragikiri Nagamasa | 4★ | Free-to-play friendly, regenerates Energy, and boosts Elemental Skill DMG. |
| Rainslasher | 4★ | EM substat benefits Swirl-focused builds, useful in Electro-Charged teams. |
| Bloodstained Greatsword | 3★ | High EM, easy to obtain, effective for teams focused on elemental reactions. |
