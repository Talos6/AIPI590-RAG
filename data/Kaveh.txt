### **Skill Leveling Priority**
- **Main Build (Bloom DPS)**: Prioritize **Elemental Burst** > **Elemental Skill** (Normal Attack not required)
- **Alternate Build (Dendro DPS)**: Prioritize **Elemental Burst** > **Normal Attack** > **Elemental Skill**

**Explanation**:
- Bloom damage is reaction-based and does not scale with skill levels, but Kaveh's Elemental Burst increases Bloom damage, so it should be leveled up.
- In a Dendro DPS build, Normal Attacks contribute more, so their priority is higher.
