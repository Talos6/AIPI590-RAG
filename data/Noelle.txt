### **Recommended Builds**

#### **Main DPS Build**

**Artifact Set Options:**  
- Best: 4-Piece Husk of Opulent Dreams + Any Off-Set Piece  
- Alternative: 4-Piece Retracing Bolide / 4-Piece Gladiator’s Finale / 4-Piece Desert Pavilion Chronicle + Any Off-Set Piece  
- With Furina: 4-Piece Marechaussee Hunter + Any Off-Set Piece  

**Reasons for Recommendations:**  
- Noelle is best used as a main DPS after unlocking her sixth constellation, *Must Be Spotless*, which significantly enhances her DEF-to-ATK conversion ratio and extends her Elemental Burst duration when defeating enemies.  
- *Marechaussee Hunter* ("Hunter Set") provides Normal and Charged Attack bonuses in its 2-piece effect and a massive CRIT Rate boost in its 4-piece effect when HP fluctuates, making it an ideal choice when paired with Furina, who can easily maintain these conditions.  
- *Husk of Opulent Dreams* provides Noelle with much-needed DEF and Geo DMG bonuses, complementing her playstyle effectively.  
- *Retracing Bolide* enhances her shield strength and Normal/Charged Attacks when under shield protection, which synergizes well with Noelle's self-sustaining nature.  
- *Gladiator’s Finale* is a viable option due to its 35% Normal Attack DMG bonus for claymore users, though its 2-piece ATK% effect is less beneficial compared to DEF scaling.  

**Main Stats:**  
- *Sands:* DEF% / Energy Recharge  
- *Goblet:* Geo DMG Bonus / DEF% (if paired with Furina)  
- *Circlet:* CRIT DMG / CRIT Rate / DEF% (Hunter Set + Redhorn Stonethresher)  

**Sub Stats Priority:**  
CRIT Rate, CRIT DMG > DEF% > Energy Recharge > ATK% > Flat DEF  

**Recommended Weapons:**  
- **Best:** *Redhorn Stonethresher* (5★) – Provides high CRIT DMG, DEF%, and DMG bonuses.  
- **Alternatives:** *Serpent Spine* (4★), *Beacon of the Reed Sea* (5★), *Whiteblind* (4★, Forgeable).

#### **Support Build**

**Artifact Set Options:**  
- *4-Piece Archaic Petra* or *4-Piece Noblesse Oblige* for boosting team DMG.  
- Hybrid sets such as *2-Piece Husk of Opulent Dreams* + *2-Piece Maiden Beloved* / *2-Piece Ocean-Hued Clam* / *2-Piece Emblem of Severed Fate* for healing and burst uptime.  

**Main Stats:**  
- *Sands:* DEF% (for non-C1) / Energy Recharge (for C1+)  
- *Goblet:* DEF%  
- *Circlet:* DEF% (for shield-focused), Healing Bonus (for healing-focused), CRIT Rate (for Favonius Greatsword users)  

**Recommended Weapons:**  
- *Favonius Greatsword* (4★) – Boosts energy generation and team utility.  
- *Sacrificial Greatsword* (4★) – Helps with skill uptime.  
- *The Bell* (4★) – Offers additional shields but is not optimal.

### **Talent Prioritization**

- **For DPS:** Normal Attack > Elemental Burst > Elemental Skill  
- **For Support:** Elemental Skill (Breastplate) only, no need to level Normal Attack or Elemental Burst.  

**Final Notes:**  
Noelle is a versatile character who excels as a Geo DPS and a durable healer/shielder. With the right investment, she can be a powerhouse in both solo and team compositions.
