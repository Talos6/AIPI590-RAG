### Recommended Builds

#### Shield Support / Healing

**Best Artifact Set:**
- 2-Piece Tenacity of the Millelith + 2-Piece Golden Troupe + Any Off-Piece
- Alternative: 2-Piece Tenacity of the Millelith or 2-Piece Golden Troupe + 2-Piece Maiden Beloved or 2-Piece Ocean-Hued Clam or 2-Piece Emblem of Severed Fate + Any Off-Piece
- Co-op: 4-Piece Tenacity of the Millelith + Any Off-Piece

**Artifact Recommendations:**
Diona's Elemental Skill "Icy Paws" generates shields based on her Max HP, while her Elemental Burst "Signature Mix" provides healing. The 2-Piece Tenacity of the Millelith and 2-Piece Golden Troupe set boost HP by 20%, increasing both her shield absorption and healing efficiency.

- **Sands:** HP% / Energy Recharge
- **Goblet:** HP%
- **Circlet:** HP%
- **Substats Priority:** HP% > Energy Recharge > HP

**Weapon Recommendations:**

| Weapon | Reason |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Favonius Warbow** (4-Star) | Best-in-slot due to its Energy Recharge and ability to generate Energy for the team. |
| **Sacrificial Bow** (4-Star) | Allows Diona to cast her Elemental Skill twice, greatly improving shield uptime and energy regeneration. |
| **Recurve Bow** (3-Star) | Maximizes HP for the strongest shields, sacrificing Energy Recharge. Useful in co-op. |
| **Elegy for the End** (5-Star) | Provides Elemental Mastery and an ATK buff, synergizing well with Diona's C6 buff and Elemental Reactions. |

### Skill Priority

**Elemental Skill > Elemental Burst (Do not level Normal Attack)**

Diona's base stats are low as a 4-star character, so skill levels are important. Her shield support role is generally more useful than her healing, making Elemental Skill a higher priority.
