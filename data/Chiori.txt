Sixfold Pure Silk | Increases the attack range of the Auto-Controlled Puppet "Sode" from Fluttering Hasu no Mai by 50%. Additionally, if there is another Geo character in the party aside from Chiori, the end of Fluttering Hasu no Mai's charge will trigger the following effects: Summons an additional Sode. Chiori can only have one extra Sode summoned this way at a time, separate from those summoned through Geo Constructs.

### Equipment Recommendations  

- Off-Field Sub-DPS  
- C6 Main DPS  

Artifact Sets:  
- General: 4-Piece Golden Troupe or 4-Piece Husk of Opulent Dreams + Any piece  
- Mixed: 2-Piece Archaic Petra + 2-Piece Golden Troupe or 2-Piece Husk of Opulent Dreams + Any piece  

**Set Reasoning:**  
Off-field Sub-DPS Chiori derives 80% of her damage from Elemental Skill, which fully benefits from the 4-piece effect of Golden Troupe. Both Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst scale off ATK and DEF, with DEF yielding higher returns, allowing Husk of Opulent Dreams to be a viable alternative. Mixed 2+2 sets can be used as a transitional option.  

**Main Stats Recommendation:**  
- **Sands:** DEF%  
- **Goblet:** Geo DMG Bonus / DEF%  
- **Circlet:** CRIT Rate / CRIT DMG / DEF%  

**Sub-Stats Recommendation:**  
CRIT Rate, CRIT DMG > DEF% > ATK% > Energy Recharge  

**Reasoning:**  
As a damage dealer, CRIT stats are essential. Between ATK and DEF, DEF provides better scaling. A moderate amount of Energy Recharge is suggested to maintain Elemental Burst uptime. If Chiori wields high CRIT DMG weapons such as Uraku Misugiri, DEF% Circlet may be viable.  

**Talent Upgrade Priority:**  
Elemental Skill > Elemental Burst (Do not upgrade Normal Attack)  

**Reasoning:**  
Off-field Sub-DPS Chiori's damage is predominantly from Elemental Skill (80%) and Elemental Burst (20%), with no reliance on Normal Attacks.  

**Best Weapon:**  
- **5★ Uraku Misugiri**  

**Reasoning:**  
Uraku Misugiri has low base ATK but high CRIT DMG, complementing Chiori’s dual-scaling mechanics. It provides significant Elemental Skill bonuses and additional DEF boosts, enhancing her Skill-centric playstyle.  

**Alternative Weapons:**  
- **4★ Wolf-Fang**  
- **5★ Primordial Jade Cutter**  
- **5★ Mistsplitter Reforged**  
- **5★ Haran Geppaku Futsu**  

**Reasoning:**  
Wolf-Fang provides CRIT Rate and boosts Elemental Skill/Burst DMG. Primordial Jade Cutter and Mistsplitter offer strong CRIT stats and elemental bonuses. Haran is a viable CRIT weapon but lacks DEF scaling benefits.  

Chiori is a strong off-field DPS with coordinated attacks and high DEF scaling, making her versatile in Geo compositions.
