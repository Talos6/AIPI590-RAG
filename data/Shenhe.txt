## Recommended Builds

### Artifact Sets

- **General Recommendations**

  - **2-Piece Gladiator's Finale** + **2-Piece Shimenawa's Reminiscence** + **(Optional 2-Piece Echoes of an Offering)**  
    or **4-Piece Noblesse Oblige**  
    or **4-Piece Blizzard Strayer** + **Any High-ATK%/CRIT Substats Pieces**

  **Reasoning:**  
  Shenhe is a Cryo support who increases party Cryo DMG via her Elemental Skill **Spring Spirit Summoning**. Its **Icy Quill** effect scales off *Shenhe’s own ATK*. Hence, artifact sets and main stats that boost her ATK are highly beneficial. 
  - **Gladiator's Finale**, **Shimenawa's Reminiscence**, and **Echoes of an Offering** each offer +18% ATK with their 2-piece effect.  
  - **Blizzard Strayer (4-Piece)** is an option especially if using **Favonius Lance** to gain CRIT Rate against Frozen or Cryo-afflicted enemies, helping with energy generation.  
  - **Noblesse Oblige (4-Piece)** is a universal support set that boosts the party’s ATK, and Shenhe can benefit from that ATK buff herself. However, its 4-piece party buff uptime might not perfectly align with all rotations.

**Main Stats Priority**  
- **Sands:** ATK% or Energy Recharge  
- **Goblet:** ATK%  
- **Circlet:** ATK%  

**Substats Priority**  
1. ATK%  
2. Energy Recharge  
3. CRIT Rate  
4. CRIT DMG  

**Explanation:**  
- Shenhe’s **Icy Quill** buff scales with her ATK.  
- Her **Elemental Burst** requires 80 Energy, so additional Energy Recharge helps ensure consistent Burst usage.  
- CRIT Rate is particularly important if you are using **Favonius Lance**, to trigger its effect reliably.

**Talent Upgrade Priority**  
1. **Elemental Skill (Spring Spirit Summoning)**  
2. **Elemental Burst (Divine Maiden's Deliverance)**  
3. Normal Attack can be left at low priority.  

**Reasoning:**  
- Most of Shenhe’s value comes from her **Elemental Skill** buffs, which scale with her ATK.  
- Her **Elemental Burst** also provides DMG bonuses and Cryo/Physical RES debuffs (when at higher levels or with certain effects), so it is worth leveling second.  
- Her Normal Attack does not significantly contribute to her main support role.

### Recommended Weapons

#### Best-in-Slot

- **5★ Calamity Queller**  
  **Reasoning:**  
  - Extremely high Base ATK and additional ATK% substat.  
  - Passive effect gives even more ATK when the character is off-field, which synergizes perfectly with Shenhe’s role as a support who uses her Skill/Burst and then swaps out.  
  - Shenhe’s buffs do not snapshot her own stats at cast time, so having a higher ATK stat off-field still benefits subsequent Icy Quill triggers.

#### Other Options

1. **4★ Favonius Lance / 5★ Engulfing Lightning / 5★ Skyward Spine**  
   - All provide **Energy Recharge** in substat or passive, helping Shenhe recharge her costly 80-energy Burst.  
   - **Favonius Lance** has decent Base ATK among 4★ polearms, and the CRIT triggers help generate particles for the team. Particularly good with a **Blizzard Strayer** build for stable CRIT hits and smoother energy rotation.  
   - **Engulfing Lightning** also converts Energy Recharge into ATK. While not fully optimal (its passive is somewhat “overkill” on certain team comps), it’s still a strong option for Shenhe.  
   - **Skyward Spine** has a fairly high Base ATK, offers Energy Recharge, and is acceptable if you need a 5★ solution for consistency.

2. **5★ Vortex Vanquisher / 5★ Primordial Jade Winged-Spear**  
   - Both grant high Base ATK and ATK% or additional ATK bonuses in their passives.  
   - **Vortex Vanquisher** can stack its passive hits or maintain them with a shield. If your team includes a shielder like Diona, you can keep the buff up more reliably.  
   - **Primordial Jade Winged-Spear** has high Base ATK and decent passive damage gains, though you may not fully utilize the on-field stacking.

3. **4★ Lithic Spear / 4★ Wavebreaker’s Fin / 4★ Prototype Starglitter / 4★ Moonpiercer**  
   - All provide significant ATK% and are viable if your artifacts supply enough Energy Recharge.  
   - **Lithic Spear** has relatively high Base ATK among 4★ weapons. Being a Liyue character automatically grants Shenhe 1 stack of its passive, and it has excellent refinements. Often considered the top 4★ pick if you can manage your Energy needs.  
   - **Wavebreaker’s Fin** boasts the highest Base ATK among 4★ weapons. It can give decent ATK boosts but the passive is more useful for high-Burst-cost teams.  
   - **Prototype Starglitter** has the same main/substat as Lithic Spear (ATK% / substat) but the passive is trickier to stack, making it less consistent.  
   - **Moonpiercer** (an event weapon from Version 3.1) gives ATK% but has lower Base ATK. At high refinement and with its effect triggered, it can surpass low-refinement Lithic Spear, but it requires triggering Elemental Reactions to summon a leaf. The Elemental Mastery it provides is effectively wasted on Shenhe.  

   *(A more detailed math comparison is sometimes folded away in the community, but the summary is: if your team composition doesn’t reliably trigger Moonpiercer’s buff or if you need more stable energy generation, **Favonius Lance** or **Lithic Spear** often remain the more practical choices.)*

#### Not Recommended Weapons
- Generally, any polearm that provides stats not relevant to Shenhe’s ATK-scaling support (e.g., Physical DMG Bonus, HP substat, etc.) is suboptimal and not recommended unless no better alternative is available.
