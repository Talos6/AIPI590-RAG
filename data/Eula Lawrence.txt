### **Recommended Builds**

#### **Standard Build**

**Artifact Sets:**  
- 4-piece Pale Flame  
- 2-piece Pale Flame + 2-piece Bloodstained Chivalry  
- Optional: 4-piece Husk of Opulent Dreams or 4-piece Marechaussee Hunter (with Furina)  

**Reasons for Selection:**  
Pale Flame’s 4-piece effect requires ramp-up time, but Eula’s standard rotation allows full uptime (without C2, avoid using Hold E immediately after Burst). The 2+2 setup guarantees a stable 50% Physical DMG Bonus, but has a lower ceiling than Pale Flame’s 4-piece bonus. If Pale Flame pieces are suboptimal, using 2 Pale Flame + 2 Bloodstained Chivalry is viable. Pale Flame 4-piece has no internal cooldown, meaning multiple Hold E hits will fully stack it immediately. When paired with Furina and without Bennett, Husk of Opulent Dreams is slightly superior to Pale Flame, but Marechaussee Hunter is not recommended due to insufficient ATK. If both Furina and Bennett are present, Marechaussee Hunter can be considered.  

**Main Stats:**  
- **Sands:** ATK%  
- **Goblet:** Physical DMG Bonus (preferred), ATK% (alternative)  
- **Circlet:** CRIT Rate, CRIT DMG, ATK%  

**Substats Priority:**  
CRIT Rate, CRIT DMG > ATK% > Energy Recharge > Flat ATK  

**Skill Leveling Priority:**  
Elemental Burst >= Normal Attack > Elemental Skill

### **Team Compositions**

#### **Superconduct Physical Team**

- **Eula + Raiden Shogun + Bennett + Rosaria/Mika**  
- **Eula + Fischl + Zhongli + Rosaria/Mika**  

Superconduct is essential for reducing enemy Physical Resistance. Raiden Shogun provides Energy Recharge and damage boost, while Bennett supplies ATK buffs and healing. Mika offers additional Physical DMG Bonus, healing, and ATK SPD increase at C6.  

#### **Cryo Resonance Build**

- **Eula + Rosaria + Raiden Shogun + Bennett**  
- **Eula + Mika + Fischl + Bennett**  

Double Cryo ensures a consistent 15% CRIT Rate increase. Rosaria can further increase Eula’s CRIT Rate via her passive. Mika provides Physical DMG Bonus and healing. Raiden Shogun, Fischl, or Lisa can serve as the Electro applier for Superconduct.
