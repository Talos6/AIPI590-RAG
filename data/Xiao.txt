#### **Artifact Recommendations**
Xiao’s primary damage comes from Plunging Attacks during his Elemental Burst. The 4-piece Marechaussee Hunter set can quickly stack 3 layers, providing up to 36% CRIT Rate. The 4-piece Vermillion Hereafter set also works well, offering up to 66% ATK boost during his Burst duration. The 4-piece Song of Days Past boosts Plunging Attack DMG and can outperform Vermillion Hereafter in certain conditions.
