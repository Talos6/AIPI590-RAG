### **Constellation Effects**

| Name | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Ordinance: Unceasing Vigil** | After using **Secret Rite: Chasmic Soulfarer**, Cyno's Normal Attack speed is increased by 20% for 10 seconds. If **Sacred Rite: Wolf's Swiftness** triggers the "Judication" effect from the passive talent **Featherfall Judgment**, its duration is refreshed. Requires unlocking the passive talent **Featherfall Judgment**. |
| **Ceremonial: Homecoming of Spirits** | When Cyno's Normal Attacks hit enemies, Electro DMG Bonus is increased by 10% for 4 seconds. This effect can trigger once every 0.1 seconds, stacking up to 5 times. |
| **Precept: Lawful Enforcer** | Increases the level of **Secret Rite: Chasmic Soulfarer** by 3, up to a maximum of level 15. |
| **Austerity: Forbidding Guard** | While Cyno is in the **Pathsworn Pathclearer** state during **Secret Rite: Wolf's Swiftness**, triggering Electro-Charged, Superconduct, Overloaded, Quicken, Aggravate, Hyperbloom, or Electro Swirl reactions restores 3 Elemental Energy for all nearby party members (excluding Cyno himself). This effect can occur up to 5 times per use of **Secret Rite: Wolf's Swiftness**. |
| **Funeral Rites: The Passing of Starlight** | Increases the level of **Sacred Rite: Wolf’s Swiftness** by 3, up to a maximum of level 15. |
| **Featherfall Judgment: Imperative Balances** | After using **Secret Rite: Chasmic Soulfarer** or triggering the "Judication" effect from **Featherfall Judgment**, Cyno gains 4 stacks of "Pactsworn Jackal." When his Normal Attacks hit opponents, a "Duststalker Bolt" is unleashed by consuming 1 stack of "Pactsworn Jackal." "Pactsworn Jackal" lasts for 8 seconds, can stack up to 8 times, and is removed when **Pathsworn Pathclearer** ends. A "Duststalker Bolt" can be fired once every 0.4 seconds this way. Requires unlocking the passive talent **Featherfall Judgment**. |

### **Recommended Builds**

#### **Artifact Set Recommendations**

| Set | Explanation |
|-----|------------|
| **4-Piece Gilded Dreams** | Provides minor ATK bonuses and a significant Elemental Mastery boost, ideal for reaction-based playstyles like Quicken and Hyperbloom. Highly synergistic with Cyno’s passive talents, especially when using **Staff of the Scarlet Sands**. |
| **4-Piece Thundering Fury** | Grants Electro DMG Bonus and reaction-based damage boosts. Allows frequent use of **Secret Rite: Chasmic Soulfarer**, reducing energy recharge needs. However, its cooldown reduction effect is harder to optimize at C0. |
| **4-Piece Marechaussee Hunter** | Provides Normal Attack bonuses and a high Crit Rate boost, making it ideal when paired with Furina. Outside of this pairing, its uptime is inconsistent. |
| **Mixed Sets** | Combining **2-Piece Thundering Fury**, **2-Piece Wanderer’s Troupe**, **2-Piece Gilded Dreams**, **2-Piece Flower of Paradise Lost**, or **2-Piece Emblem of Severed Fate** can yield damage comparable to other full sets. |

#### **Main Stats Priorities**
- **Sands:** Elemental Mastery > ATK% (if using high Base ATK weapon) > Energy Recharge (if single Electro team)
- **Goblet:** Electro DMG Bonus
- **Circlet:** Crit Rate / Crit DMG > Elemental Mastery (for Hyperbloom builds)

#### **Substat Priorities**
Crit Rate, Crit DMG, Elemental Mastery > Energy Recharge, ATK%

#### **Talent Upgrade Priority**
Elemental Burst ≥ Elemental Skill, do not upgrade Normal Attack.

#### **Recommended Weapons**

| Weapon | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **5★ Staff of the Scarlet Sands** | Best-in-slot weapon, providing Crit Rate and high synergy with Elemental Mastery scaling. |
| **4★ Ballad of the Fjords** | Best 4-star option, offering high Crit Rate and Elemental Mastery boosts. |
| **5★ Primordial Jade Winged-Spear** | Provides Crit Rate and strong sustained ATK boosts. |
| **5★ Staff of Homa** | High Crit DMG weapon, though harder to optimize due to its HP-based effect. |
| **4★ Deathmatch** | Decent Crit Rate option, but lacks Elemental Mastery benefits. |
| **3★ White Tassel** | Budget alternative providing Crit Rate and Normal Attack DMG boosts. |
