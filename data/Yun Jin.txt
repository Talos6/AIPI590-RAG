**Recommended Builds**  

### **General Support Build**  
- **Artifact Set:**  
  - Best: 4-piece Husk of Opulent Dreams / 4-piece Noblesse Oblige / 4-piece Archaic Petra  
  - Alternative: 2-piece Husk of Opulent Dreams + 2-piece Emblem of Severed Fate  
- **Main Stats:**  
  - Sands: DEF% / Energy Recharge  
  - Goblet: DEF%  
  - Circlet: DEF% / Crit Rate (if using Favonius Lance)  
- **Substats:** Crit Rate (if using Favonius Lance), DEF%, Energy Recharge, Flat DEF  
- **Recommended Weapons:**  
  - Best: 4-star Favonius Lance / 4-star Kitain Cross Spear / 4-star Rightful Reward / 5-star Engulfing Lightning  
  - Alternative: 4-star Prototype Starglitter / 4-star "The Catch" / 5-star Skyward Spine  

**Set Recommendations:**  
- **Husk vs. Noblesse:**  
  - For characters with low base attack, like Qiqi with Harbinger of Dawn, Husk is better than Noblesse Oblige.  
  - For higher-multiplier characters like Yoimiya or Razor, ensuring Noblesse Oblige is used somewhere in the team is more important than Husk.  
  
**Artifact Comparison:**  
- **Husk 4-piece vs. 2+2 Set:**  
  - Husk 2-piece grants 30% DEF, while Husk 4-piece adds another 24%. Alternatively, you can pair Husk 2-piece with 2-piece Emblem for 20% Energy Recharge.  
- **Husk vs. Noblesse:**  
  - Husk provides more benefits to Yun Jin’s own DEF scaling, while Noblesse is better if no other character is using it in the team.  

**Skill Priorities:**  
- **Only level up Elemental Burst,** ignore Normal Attacks and Elemental Skill.

**Weapon Recommendations**  

### **Best Weapons**  
- **4-star Favonius Lance**  
  - Provides Energy Recharge and helps generate particles for the team. Requires a decent amount of Crit Rate for consistency.  
- **4-star Kitain Cross Spear**  
  - Generates additional Energy and is effective when highly refined. However, it may interfere with skill timing.  
- **4-star Rightful Reward**  
  - Offers Energy Recharge and additional healing restoration upon using skills, making it an alternative choice.  
- **5-star Engulfing Lightning**  
  - Grants Energy Recharge and improves Energy regeneration after Elemental Burst usage. However, the ATK bonus it provides is not useful for Yun Jin.  

### **Alternative Weapons**  
- **4-star Prototype Starglitter**  
  - A solid Energy Recharge weapon with a craftable option.  
- **4-star "The Catch"**  
  - Good Energy Recharge, though the weapon’s passive isn’t fully utilized.  
- **5-star Skyward Spine**  
  - Offers both Energy Recharge and increased attack speed. Though attack speed isn’t a priority, it’s a decent alternative.  

### **Situational Weapon**  
- **4-star Deathmatch**  
  - The only spear with a DEF% bonus, though it has conditional activation. To maximize its effect, Yun Jin should be on-field when facing multiple enemies before casting her Burst.  

### **Not Recommended Weapons**  
- **4-star Lithic Spear / Crescent Pike**  
  - These weapons focus on offensive stats that don’t benefit Yun Jin’s playstyle.
