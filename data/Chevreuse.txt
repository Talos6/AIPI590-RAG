### **Constellation Effects**

| Name | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Determined Defense** | When an active character under "Coordinated Tactics" (excluding Chevreuse) triggers an Overloaded reaction against enemies, they restore 6 Energy. This effect can occur once every 10s. Requires the "Vanguard Coordinated Tactics" talent. |
| **Guided Detonation Sniping** | Holding "Rapid Volley Barrage" to fire a shot triggers 2 additional chain explosions at the impact point, each dealing Pyro DMG equal to 120% of Chevreuse's ATK. This effect can occur once every 10s, and the damage is considered Elemental Skill DMG. |
| **Expert Reloading** | Increases the level of "Rapid Volley Barrage" by 3, up to a maximum of level 15. |
| **Multi-Shot Mastery** | After casting "Ordnance Barrage Bombardment," Chevreuse's Elemental Skill cooldown is reduced by 100% for 6 seconds, allowing her to cast it twice before the effect ends. |
| **Augmented Firepower** | Increases the level of "Ordnance Barrage Bombardment" by 3, up to a maximum of level 15. |
| **Pursuit of Justice** | After "Rapid Volley Barrage" heals a character, it grants the entire team a 20% Pyro and Electro DMG Bonus for 8s. This effect stacks up to 3 times, with each stack having its own independent duration. Additionally, 12s after healing, it restores HP to all nearby party members equal to 10% of Chevreuse’s Max HP. |
