### Constellations

| Name | Effect |
|---|---|
| **"The Happiest Sprite, Can She Understand Anxiety?"** | The Bouncing Hydrotherapy’s healing water balls can bounce 3 additional times. The first 3 bounces will not cause the large healing water ball to shrink. Additionally, the effect of the passive talent **"Proper Rest is Necessary"** is enhanced: When the healing water ball bounces, Sigewinne gains 1 **Rest Count**, and the damage increase from **Rest Count** is modified as follows: For every 1,000 Max HP exceeding 30,000, increase damage by 100 (capped at 3,500 damage). This effect requires unlocking the passive talent **"Proper Rest is Necessary"**. |
| **"The Kindest Sprite, Can She Resolve Hostility?"** | Upon casting **Bouncing Hydrotherapy** and **Supersaturated Heart Injection**, generates a water shield that absorbs damage equal to 30% of Max HP and has a 250% absorption bonus against Hydro damage. This shield lasts until the skill is completed. Additionally, when healing water balls from **Bouncing Hydrotherapy** or **Supersaturated Heart Injection** hit an enemy, their Hydro RES is reduced by 35% for 8 seconds. |
| **"The Healthiest Sprite, Can She Cure Fevers?"** | Increases **Bouncing Hydrotherapy** skill level by 3, up to a maximum of level 15. |
| **"The Most Beautiful Sprite, Can She Refuse Decay?"** | Increases the duration of **Supersaturated Heart Injection** by 3 seconds. |
| **"The Happiest Sprite, Can She Banish Torment?"** | Increases **Supersaturated Heart Injection** skill level by 3, up to a maximum of level 15. |
| **"The Brightest Sprite, Can She Pray for Me?"** | When Sigewinne heals, she gains a Crit Rate and Crit DMG boost for **Supersaturated Heart Injection** based on her Max HP: For every 1,000 Max HP, Crit Rate increases by 0.4% and Crit DMG by 2.2%, lasting for 15 seconds. This effect caps at a 20% Crit Rate and 110% Crit DMG increase. |
