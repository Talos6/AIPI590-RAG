### **Recommended Builds**

#### **Artifact Set Recommendation**

- **Direct Damage/Pure Aggravate**
- **Hyperbloom/Burgeon**

| Recommended Set | 4-piece Emblem of Severed Fate + Any Off-piece |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Reasoning**  | Raiden Shogun's Elemental Burst requires 90 Energy, making her heavily reliant on Energy Recharge. Her damage output mainly comes from her Elemental Burst, which synergizes well with the Emblem of Severed Fate set. At 300% Energy Recharge, she gains maximum damage bonus. |

#### **Main Stat Recommendations**

| Slot | Main Stat |
|------|-----------|
| Sands | Energy Recharge / ATK% |
| Goblet | Electro DMG Bonus / ATK% |
| Circlet | CRIT Rate / CRIT DMG |

#### **Sub-stat Prioritization**

Energy Recharge (if not using an Energy Recharge weapon) > CRIT Rate, CRIT DMG > ATK% > Energy Recharge (if using an Energy Recharge weapon)

**Reasoning:** While Energy Recharge is beneficial for Raiden Shogun’s overall damage, CRIT Rate and CRIT DMG have a higher direct impact on her output. Her passive talent, "Enlightened One," converts excess Energy Recharge (beyond 100%) into Electro DMG Bonus and supports the entire team's Energy regeneration. Typically, Raiden Shogun should maintain 230%–270% Energy Recharge, prioritizing CRIT stats afterward. 

For weapons with high Energy Recharge, her artifact sub-stats should focus on CRIT Rate, CRIT DMG, and ATK%. For weapons with high CRIT stats, Energy Recharge becomes a viable sub-stat to reduce artifact farming difficulty. The synergy between Emblem of Severed Fate and "Enlightened One" also makes her Goblet choice dependent on the team composition: if the team has multiple ATK buffers (e.g., Kujou Sara + Bennett), Electro DMG Goblet is better; if the team has multiple DMG buffs (e.g., Yelan + Kazuha), ATK% Goblet may perform similarly. 

#### **Skill Leveling Priority**

Elemental Burst > Elemental Skill (Normal Attack not recommended)

**Reasoning:** Raiden Shogun’s attacks during her Elemental Burst are considered Elemental Burst damage, scaling off her Burst level, meaning Normal Attack levels are unnecessary. While her Elemental Skill increases the team’s Elemental Burst DMG, it does not deal high personal damage, making it a lower priority.

#### **Best-in-Slot Weapon**

| **Weapon** | **Engulfing Lightning (5★)** |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| **Reasoning** | Aesthetically fitting, high Energy Recharge secondary stat, and a passive that converts Energy Recharge into ATK, reducing her dependency on Kujou Sara and Bennett. If Energy Recharge investment lowers ATK, consider an ATK% Sands or Goblet to compensate. |

#### **Alternative Weapon Choices**

**4★:** The Catch, Wavebreaker's Fin, Deathmatch  
**5★:** Staff of the Scarlet Sands, Staff of Homa, Skyward Spine, Primordial Jade-Winged Spear, Calamity Queller, Vortex Vanquisher  

**Weapon Selection Notes:**
- The Catch (4★) is a free-to-play friendly option with solid performance.
- Staff of the Scarlet Sands and Staff of Homa provide high CRIT stats, boosting Raiden Shogun’s damage.
- Skyward Spine offers extra Energy Recharge and attack speed, improving smoothness in Burst execution.
