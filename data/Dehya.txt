### **Talent Upgrade Priority**

**Priority:** Elemental Burst > Elemental Skill (Normal Attack is not necessary)

**Reason:** Dehya’s primary damage output comes from her Elemental Burst, making it the highest priority. Her Elemental Skill provides damage mitigation, making it also important. Normal Attack is not recommended for upgrading.
