### **Introduction**  
A traveler drifting from beyond the world, whose blood relative was taken by the gods. From then on, they embarked on a journey to seek the Seven Archons.

### **Special Note:**  
During **Sumeru Archon Quest Chapter III, Act I, Section 7 - "The Approaching Goal,"** players are required to use **"One-Handed Sword Combat Technique • Eight."** At this time, the base attack of **only the Traveler** (white stat) is permanently increased by 3 points. If this part of the storyline has already been completed, remember to add this 3-point base attack when calculating stats. Additionally, this value has the following characteristics:

- It is directly added to the Traveler’s stat panel and is included in the **final attack calculation formula** under "Character Attack."
- This 3-point base attack bonus is not affected by the Traveler’s current level, meaning all Travelers at any level benefit from it.
- This value remains effective even after switching the Traveler’s elemental alignment.

### **Recommended Builds**

#### **Sub-DPS (Anemo Damage Focused)**
- **Artifacts:** 4-piece **Viridescent Venerer** (Best) / 4-piece **Instructor** (Early Game)
- **Sands:** ATK% / Elemental Mastery / Energy Recharge
- **Goblet:** Anemo DMG Bonus / Elemental Mastery
- **Circlet:** Crit Rate / Crit DMG / Elemental Mastery
- **Substats:** Crit Rate, Crit DMG, ATK%, Elemental Mastery, Energy Recharge

**Why This Build?**
The **Viridescent Venerer 4-piece bonus** reduces enemy resistance to Swirled elements by 40%, making it the best set for Anemo supports. Unlike other Traveler elements, Anemo Traveler is mainly used for support, making this set the optimal choice. In early-game, **Instructor 4-piece** can be a good alternative to boost team Elemental Mastery.

#### **All-Element Utility Build**
- Focus on **Elemental Mastery** to maximize Swirl damage.
- Weapons like **Iron Sting** or **Sacrificial Sword** work well.
- Energy Recharge is valuable for frequent Burst uptime.

This build makes Traveler a great **reaction enabler** in teams that rely on Swirl to boost other elements’ damage.
