### **Recommended Build**

#### **Artifact Set Recommendations**

**Physical DMG Build**  
- **Best Set:** 4-Piece Pale Flame  
  - **2-Piece Effect:** Increases Physical DMG by 25%.
  - **4-Piece Effect:** When an Elemental Skill hits an enemy, ATK is increased by 9% for 7 seconds. This effect can stack twice and can be triggered once every 0.3 seconds. Once two stacks are achieved, the 2-Piece effect is increased by 100%.
  - **Alternative Sets:**
    - 2-Piece Pale Flame + 2-Piece Bloodstained Chivalry (Physical DMG +25%)
    - 2-Piece Pale Flame + 2-Piece Gladiator’s Finale (ATK +18%)

**Artifact Stats**
- **Sands:** ATK%
- **Goblet:** Physical DMG Bonus
- **Circlet:** CRIT Rate / CRIT DMG

**Substats Priority:** CRIT Rate, CRIT DMG > ATK%

**Reasoning:** As a Physical DMG dealer, Freminet benefits from CRIT stats, ATK%, and Physical DMG bonuses. Since his ascension stat is ATK%, CRIT stats become even more valuable.

---

### **Talent Priority**
1. **Normal Attack > Elemental Skill**  (Elemental Burst not needed)

**Reasoning:** Freminet’s primary damage output comes from Normal Attacks and Elemental Skill. His Elemental Burst does not contribute significantly to his Physical DMG playstyle.

---

### **Best Weapons**

#### **Best 5-Star Weapon**
**Beacon of the Reed Sea** (Claymore)  
- **CRIT Rate:** 7.2% - 33.1%
- **Effect:** Increases ATK by 20%-40% when an Elemental Skill hits an enemy or when taking damage. When not protected by a shield, increases Max HP by 32%-64%.
- **Reasoning:** Provides high CRIT Rate and ATK bonus, making it an optimal weapon for Freminet.

#### **Alternative 5-Star Weapons**
- **Song of Broken Pines**: High base ATK, Physical DMG bonus, and ATK boost.
- **Wolf’s Gravestone**: High ATK bonus, great for team buffs.
- **The Unforged**: Synergizes well with shield supports.
- **Skyward Pride**: High base ATK and Energy Recharge for sustained damage.
- **Redhorn Stonethresher**: High CRIT DMG boost but requires DEF scaling.

#### **Best 4-Star Weapon**
- **Serpent Spine**: High CRIT Rate and damage bonus.
- **Luxurious Sea-Lord**: Decent ATK bonus.
- **Prototype Archaic**: Free-to-play friendly with high burst damage.

**Conclusion:** Freminet excels as a Physical DMG dealer, leveraging his Elemental Skill and Normal Attacks. His best setup includes the Pale Flame artifact set and a high CRIT weapon like Beacon of the Reed Sea or Song of Broken Pines. His build focuses on maximizing CRIT and Physical DMG while ensuring sufficient ATK scaling.
