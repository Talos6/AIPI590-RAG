Note: In the quest "Sumeru Archon Quest Chapter 3, Act 1 - The Approaching Storm," the player must use "One-Handed Sword Combat Technique • Eight" as part of the story. During this event, only the Traveler's base attack power (white number) is permanently increased by 3 points. If this part of the story has been completed, ensure to include this additional 3 base attack power in calculations. Additionally, this value has the following properties:
- It is directly added to the Traveler's stats and is considered in the "Final Attack Calculation Formula" under "Character Attack."
- The 3 base attack points are unaffected by the Traveler's current level, meaning they are always applied regardless of level.
- The bonus remains active even if the Traveler switches their elemental affinity.
