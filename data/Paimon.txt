**Paimon**

---

### **General Information**

- **Titles:** Mascot, Guide, Teyvat’s Best Travel Companion
- **Gender:** Female
- **English Name:** Paimon
- **Specialty Dish:** "Paimon’s Special" Slime Drink

**Character Description:**
After the Traveler falls into the world of Teyvat and awakens, they recall catching a peculiar floating creature while fishing in the water—Paimon. She voluntarily becomes the Traveler’s guide, accompanying them on their journey to find their lost sibling.

Throughout their adventures, Paimon plays a key role in conversations and interactions since the Traveler is mostly silent. Despite her gluttonous and money-loving nature—often getting excited about treasure, rewards, and food—she deeply cares about the Traveler’s safety and values their friendship above all. She repeatedly emphasizes that she is the Traveler’s best companion and will never leave them, sincerely hoping they will reunite with their sibling.

As an "emergency food" herself, Paimon is also an enthusiastic eater. After meeting Xiangling, she discovers a new world of cuisine, developing a particular fondness for Slime-based dishes. The Traveler once joked: "She eats a lot but never gains weight. That’s unqualified as emergency food, right?"

In **Sumeru’s Archon Quest**, Paimon expresses her disappointment upon learning that the traditional dish "Seven Treasures Table" consists of seven vegetarian dishes, instead fantasizing about the meat dishes of Natlan’s festivals. In Fontaine’s world quests, she entrusts her personal "secret stash" of Mora to the Traveler, which can actually be used (15,000 Mora).

During the **Version 4.1 event**, Paimon tries to come up with a riddle about the Jade Chamber but ends up perfectly describing herself:
> "What has no wings yet can fly,
> Floating midair, never tired;
> Stomach full of Mora bright,
> Sinking deep, lost to sight."
Xingqiu then adds:
> "A guide beside the Traveler's way,
> Loved by all, praised every day."

In **the Primordial Sea Dragon event**, Ranjit wishes for a flying companion and asks what Paimon’s special skill is, to which the Traveler responds: "She can make food disappear instantly."

Paimon serves as **Genshin Impact's** app icon and the official avatar on social media platforms. In-game rewards distributed by HoYoverse are often signed as "P.A.I.M.O.N." She frequently appears in promotional event artwork.
