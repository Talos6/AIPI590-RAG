### Constellations

**Name** | **Effect**  
--- | ---  
**"Henceforth, Passing Through the Veil of Candlelight"** | During Clorinde’s "Night Patrol" state from her skill "Night Hunt," Normal Attack hits summon Night Patrol Shadows near enemies, performing two coordinated attacks, each dealing 30% of Clorinde’s ATK as Electro DMG. This effect can trigger once every 1.2s and is considered Normal Attack DMG.  
**"Henceforth, Facing the Perils of the Long Night"** | The passive talent "Bright Flame in the Night" is enhanced: When nearby party members trigger Electro-related reactions, Clorinde’s Normal Attack and "Final Glimmer" damage increase by 30% of her ATK for 15s. This effect stacks up to 3 times, each stack counted separately. When at 3 stacks, Clorinde gains increased interruption resistance. This effect can increase her damage by a maximum of 2700.  
**"I Shall Remember the Oath of Daylight"** | Increases "Night Hunt" skill level by 3. Maximum upgrade level is 15.  
**"Remember the Tears, Life, and Compassion"** | When "Final Glimmer" hits an enemy, its damage increases based on Clorinde’s current Life Bond percentage. Each 1% Life Bond increases "Final Glimmer" DMG by 2%, up to a maximum increase of 200%.  
**"Also Remember, Dawn Will Arrive"** | Increases "Final Glimmer" skill level by 3. Maximum upgrade level is 15.  
**"For This, Do Not Forsake Hope"** | For 12s after using "Night Hunt," Clorinde gains 10% CRIT Rate and 70% CRIT DMG. Additionally, during "Night Patrol," "Bright Candle Shadows" appear under specific conditions to perform chase attacks, dealing 200% of Clorinde’s ATK as Electro DMG. These attacks are considered Normal Attack DMG. "Bright Candle Shadows" appear when Clorinde is about to be hit or when executing "Nocturnal Edict." This effect can trigger once per second, up to 6 times per "Night Patrol." Additionally, during "Night Patrol," Clorinde takes 80% reduced damage and gains enhanced interruption resistance. This effect ends either when "Night Patrol" ends or after summoning 6 "Bright Candle Shadows."
