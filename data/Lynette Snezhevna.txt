## Character Build Recommendations

Below are two common approaches to building Lynette: **(1) Anemo RES shred support** and **(2) Main-field Anemo DPS** (especially with C6 unlocked).

---

### **Build 1: Anemo Resistance-Shred Support**

**Recommended Artifact Set**  
- **4-Piece Viridescent Venerer** + any off-piece

**Reasoning:**  
- Without C6 (“The Eye That Reveals True Intent”), Lynette is generally recommended to equip **4-Piece Viridescent Venerer** to serve as a team support that lowers enemies’ Elemental RES via Swirl.  
- Note that **Viridescent Venerer**’s 4-piece effect requires Lynette to trigger the Swirl reaction **while on-field**. Swirls caused by the “Bogglecat Box” from Lynette’s Elemental Burst *while she is off-field* will **not** activate the 4-piece Viridescent Venerer debuff.

**Main Stat Recommendations**  
- **Sands:** Energy Recharge% or ATK%  
- **Goblet:** Anemo DMG Bonus  
- **Circlet:** CRIT DMG or CRIT Rate  

**Substat Priority:**  
Energy Recharge% > CRIT DMG / CRIT Rate > ATK% > Flat ATK

**Explanation:**  
- Lynette’s Elemental Burst, **Magic: Trick of the Scales**, requires 70 Energy. She needs sufficient Energy Recharge to maintain her rotation.  
- CRIT Rate / CRIT DMG and ATK% help boost her personal damage.

**Talent Level Priority**  
- No particular need to invest in talent levels for a pure RES shred role.  
- **Reason:** Like Kazuha in a heavy support build, Lynette’s damage is relatively low if she isn’t used as a DPS. Her main purpose is to shred enemy RES, so leveling her talents isn’t crucial.

**Recommended 5★ “BiS” Weapon**  
- **Freedom-Sworn**  

**Reason:**  
- **Freedom-Sworn** provides a teamwide ATK% buff and normal/charged/plunging DMG Bonus, and also boosts Lynette’s personal damage. This weapon is useful both in a support role and if you later decide to have Lynette deal more on-field damage.

**Recommended 4★ Weapons**  
- **Favonius Sword**  
- **Sacrificial Sword**  

**Reason:**  
- Both are four-star swords suitable for a support Lynette, providing extra Energy Recharge or enabling more frequent use of her Elemental Skill.  
- **Favonius Sword:** requires sufficient CRIT Rate to trigger its Energy particles consistently.  
- **Sacrificial Sword:** can reset the cooldown of Lynette’s Elemental Skill **Mystique Maneuver**, letting her use it twice in a row—though note that the portion called “Ferity: Dire” summoned by her skill has its own separate cooldown that is **not** reset by this weapon.

**Another 4★ Option**  
- **Finale of the Deep (Fontaine Fishing Association)**  

**Reason:**  
- Easy to refine, provides a direct CRIT Rate bonus for Lynette’s Elemental Skill, along with a high Energy Recharge substat. This greatly eases her Energy needs.

---

### **Build 2: Main-Field Anemo DPS (Recommended with C6)**

**Recommended Artifact Sets**  
- **Best:** 4-Piece Marechaussee Hunter + any off-piece  
- **Alternative:** 4-Piece Desert Pavilion Chronicle + any off-piece  
- **Mixed:** 2-Piece Viridescent Venerer + 2-Piece Desert Pavilion Chronicle or 2-Piece Gladiator’s Finale (any +18% ATK set), etc.

**Reasoning:**  
- With Lynette’s C6 (“The Eye That Reveals True Intent”), she gains Anemo Infusion and a 20% Anemo DMG Bonus for 6 seconds after using her skill’s thrust, giving her genuine on-field carry potential.  
- **Marechaussee Hunter** is strong for characters whose HP fluctuates, granting them high CRIT Rate. Lynette’s Elemental Skill continually alters her HP, making good use of this set.  
- **Desert Pavilion Chronicle** is a great option for Anemo DMG characters who primarily deal Normal/Charged Attacks.

**Main Stat Recommendations**  
- **Sands:** ATK%  
- **Goblet:** Anemo DMG Bonus  
- **Circlet:** CRIT DMG or CRIT Rate  

**Substat Priority:**  
CRIT Rate / CRIT DMG > ATK% > Energy Recharge% > Flat ATK

**Explanation:**  
- Like other standard DPS units, Lynette benefits from CRIT Rate / CRIT DMG and ATK%.  
- She still needs enough Energy Recharge to cast her 70-cost Burst comfortably.

**Talent Level Priority**  
- **Normal Attack** > **Elemental Skill** > **Elemental Burst**  
- **Reason:** At C6, Lynette’s damage primarily comes from Normal/Charged Attacks under Anemo Infusion, so leveling her Normal Attack talents is especially valuable. Her Elemental Skill also contributes damage, but less than the buffed Normal/Charged attacks. Her Elemental Burst damage is relatively minor, so it has the lowest priority.

**Recommended 5★ “BiS” Weapons**  
- **Mistsplitter Reforged**  
- *(Conditional)* **The First Great Magic** if you have an aligned party with Geo units, etc. (In the Chinese text, it’s listed under “Bound to Geo.” Officially, this is **The First Great Magic** / “The First Great Magic: Rockfold.”)  

**Reason:**  
- **Mistsplitter Reforged** is Lynette’s top pick for maximizing personal damage, especially if her C6 grants her consistent Anemo Infusion to fully trigger the sword’s passive.  
- **The First Great Magic** can rival Mistsplitter if a Geo character is in the party (e.g., Zhongli). If you lack Geo teammates, Mistsplitter generally outperforms it.

**Other 5★ Weapon Options**  
- **Primordial Jade Cutter**  
- **Haran Geppaku Futsu**  

**Reason:**  
- **Primordial Jade Cutter** offers a high CRIT Rate substat, HP%, and an HP-to-ATK conversion—though it has lower base ATK. Its large CRIT Rate bonus is ideal for sets like **Desert Pavilion** but less ideal for **Marechaussee Hunter** (which also gives CRIT Rate).  
- **Haran Geppaku Futsu** has a CRIT Rate substat and boosts Normal Attack DMG. Lynette can maintain the buff fairly easily, though it demands certain Normal Attack sequences.

**Recommended 4★ Weapons**  
- **The Black Sword**  
- **Wolf-Fang**  
- **Toukabou Shigure** (or “Sapwood Blade” variants if the naming differs—though the text specifically mentions **“海渊终曲”** or “Finale of the Deep,” which is the fishing sword in Chinese is *different* from Toukabou Shigure. To match the user’s text, see below.)  
- **Finale of the Deep** (as a forging or fishing weapon in Fontaine)  

**Reasons:**  
1. **The Black Sword:** A strong 4★ choice for Normal and Charged Attack damage, also provides self-healing. The healing helps maintain HP changes and synergy with Marechaussee Hunter’s effect.  
2. **Wolf-Fang:** (Battle Pass weapon) Offers 27.6% CRIT Rate at Lv90, plus extra Elemental Skill and Burst DMG from its passive.  
3. **Tidal Shadow (or “Finale of the Deep”)**: A craftable or fish-exchange sword in Fontaine (depending on the official naming). It grants ATK% after receiving healing, which pairs well with supportive teammates.

*(Note: The text references various 4★ swords. Check in-game or official sources for their final English names.)*

**Not Recommended Weapon**  
- **3★ Harbinger of Dawn**  

**Reason:**  
- Lynette’s Elemental Skill **Mystique Maneuver** continuously drains her HP, making it hard to remain above 90% HP to maintain *Harbinger of Dawn*’s CRIT bonus.

---

### Team Compositions

#### Anemo DPS Approach

- Like Sucrose, Lynette can serve as a **RES shred** support using **Viridescent Venerer** while providing a Taunt, small crowd control (especially from her C1), and an ATK buff.  
- Unlike Sucrose, Lynette does **not** provide a party-wide Elemental Mastery buff, but rather a small ATK buff (and requires a specific constellation to gather enemies effectively).  
- **At C6**, Lynette gains notable on-field potential with a 6s Anemo Infusion and Anemo DMG Bonus after using her skill. Her synergy with **Faruzan** (for dedicated Anemo support) becomes especially strong, and teammates like **Bennett**, **Zhongli**, or **Furina** can help sustain her or buff her damage.  
- If you own **Jean** with C4 (which also provides an Anemo RES shred), she’s another good support partner. If you have **Freminet** (or “ChoixduBois?” – official name is “Freminet”), you could consider combos focusing on plunging attacks if desired.

**Sample Team (C6 On-field Lynette)**  
- **Lynette (Main DPS)**  
- **Faruzan (Anemo Support)**  
- **Bennett (ATK Buff + Healing)**  
- **Zhongli (Shield + Universal RES shred)**  
  - or **Furina** / **Jean** / etc.  

Below is the user’s provided example table (simplified). Aim for around *70%/140%* CRIT on Lynette, 260%+ Energy Recharge on Faruzan if she’s not C6, around 220% Energy Recharge on Bennett, and high HP on Zhongli or other supports.
