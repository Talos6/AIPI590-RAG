**Recommended Builds**

* **Charged Attack Build**
* **Physical Rapid-Fire (C1)**
* **Baron Bunny Nuke (C2)**
* **Burst Sub-DPS (Recommended at C6)**
* **Beginner Exploration**

**Artifact Sets**

- **General:** 4-piece Wanderer's Troupe + any off-piece
- **Optional:** 4-piece Shimenawa's Reminiscence + any off-piece

**Artifact Set Reasoning:** Amber's constellations allow for diverse playstyles, with the Charged Attack build being the most versatile without strict constellation requirements. As a Pyro character, pairing Amber with Hydro or Cryo teammates to trigger Vaporize or Melt reactions is ideal. The 2-piece Wanderer's Troupe provides 80 Elemental Mastery, enhancing reaction damage, and the 4-piece effect grants a consistent 35% Charged Attack Damage bonus, making it the most stable artifact set for this playstyle.

**Main Stat Recommendations:**

- **Sands:** Elemental Mastery, ATK%
- **Goblet:** Pyro DMG Bonus
- **Circlet:** CRIT DMG > CRIT Rate

**Substat Recommendations:** CRIT DMG, Elemental Mastery, CRIT Rate, ATK%

**Stat Reasoning:** Traditional DPS configurations focus on CRIT stats and ATK%. Elemental Mastery boosts reaction damage, which is significant for Amber's Charged Attack playstyle. Given that bow characters' Aimed Shots on weak points guarantee a CRIT, players confident in their aim can prioritize CRIT DMG over CRIT Rate. However, with an increasing number of enemies lacking weak points, maintaining a balanced CRIT Rate (around 50%) is advisable for general use.

**Talent Priority:** Normal Attack > Elemental Skill = Elemental Burst

**Talent Reasoning:** For the Charged Attack build, Amber's primary damage source is her Charged Attack, making leveling her Normal Attack talent the top priority. Both Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst contribute to her damage and can be leveled accordingly.

**Recommended Weapons:**

- **5-Star:**
  - **Amos' Bow:** Provides ATK% and increases Charged Attack DMG, perfectly aligning with Amber's playstyle.
  - **Hunter's Path:** Offers high CRIT Rate, easing artifact stat requirements, and increases Charged Attack DMG based on Elemental Mastery, synergizing well with reaction-based builds.
  - **The First Great Magic:** Grants CRIT DMG and boosts Charged Attack DMG, making it a strong choice for Amber's Charged Attack focus.

- **4-Star:**
  - **Solar Pearl:** Provides CRIT Rate and increases Elemental Skill and Burst DMG, beneficial for a balanced DPS approach.
  - **Hamayumi:** Increases Normal and Charged Attack DMG, especially when Amber's Energy is full, complementing her Charged Attack playstyle.
