**Constellation**

| Name | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Rebuke the Wicked with Fear** | The "Edict of Grace" from the passive talent "The Law Knows No Kindness" is modified as follows: When Wriothesley's HP is below 60%, or while in the Cold Penalty state of Icefang Rush, landing the fifth hit of Repelling Fist grants "Edict of Grace" once every 2.5 seconds. Additionally, Reprisal: Vaulting Fist gains the following enhancements: its damage bonus increases to 200%; when it hits a target in the Cold Penalty state, the state’s duration is extended by 4 seconds (can only be extended once per state instance). Requires unlocking the passive talent "The Law Knows No Kindness." |
| **Shackle the Arrogant with Chains** | When casting Black Gold Wolfbite, each stack of "Restitution" from the passive talent "All Sins Shall Reap Their Due" increases the damage dealt by 40%. Requires unlocking the passive talent "All Sins Shall Reap Their Due." |
| **Condemn the Deceitful with Judgment** | Increases the level of Normal Attack: Swiftfrost Fisticuffs by 3, up to a maximum level of 15. |
| **Redeem the Suffering with Mercy** | The healing effect of Reprisal: Vaulting Fist increases to 50% of Wriothesley’s Max HP. Additionally, if Wriothesley receives healing that exceeds his maximum HP, different effects will be triggered based on whether he is on the field or off the field. If on the field, his attack speed increases by 20% for 4 seconds; if off the field, all party members’ attack speed increases by 10% for 6 seconds. These two effects cannot stack. Requires unlocking the passive talent "The Law Knows No Kindness." |
| **Pardon the Wronged with Compassion** | Increases the level of Black Gold Wolfbite by 3, up to a maximum level of 15. |
| **Console the Innocent with Warmth** | Reprisal: Vaulting Fist’s Crit Rate increases by 10%, Crit DMG increases by 80%, and an additional ice spike is generated, dealing Cryo DMG equal to 100% of its original value. Damage from this ice spike is considered Charged Attack DMG. Requires unlocking the passive talent "The Law Knows No Kindness." |
