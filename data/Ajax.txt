## **Recommended Build**

### **Artifact Recommendations**
- **Best-in-slot:** 4-piece Nymph's Dream + any additional piece  
- **Hybrid Set:** 2-piece Heart of Depth + 2-piece Nymph's Dream / Gladiator's Finale / Wanderer's Troupe / Noblesse Oblige / Any 2-piece set with +18% ATK or +80 Elemental Mastery  
- **Alternative:** 4-piece Heart of Depth (best suited for full Constellation playstyle)

### **Artifact Set Explanation**
With the release of Version 3.6, the new artifact set Nymph's Dream has become the optimal set for Tartaglia. He can easily maintain 3 stacks of its effect using normal combat mechanics. The 2-piece bonus also perfectly synergizes with his kit, making it his best-in-slot set. Compared to a traditional 2+2 hybrid setup, the 4-piece Nymph's Dream set offers a 4-7% damage boost (depending on team composition and setup). 

If your existing artifacts already have excellent substats, farming an entirely new set may not be necessary. However, if using 4-piece Nymph’s Dream, keep in mind that **Bennett should not use the Instructor set**, as Nymph's Dream lasts only 8 seconds, and re-stacking would prevent Tartaglia from benefiting from Instructor’s bonus.

For hybrid 2+2 builds: 
- If prioritizing **Burst Damage**, use 2 Heart of Depth + 2 Elemental Mastery / Noblesse Oblige (with C2 Kazuha, use Noblesse; without, use Elemental Mastery).  
- If aiming for a **balanced build**, use 2 Heart of Depth + 2 Heart of Depth / 2 ATK% set.  

The 4-piece Heart of Depth set can outperform 2+2 in Normal and Charged Attacks **if there are external ATK boosts (e.g., Bennett or Polar Star)**, but it does not boost Riptide or Elemental Burst damage, making it suboptimal in many cases.

### **Main Stats Priority**
- **Sands:** ATK%  
- **Goblet:** Hydro DMG Bonus  
- **Circlet:** CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG  

### **Substats Priority**
CRIT Rate / CRIT DMG > ATK% > Elemental Mastery > Energy Recharge

## **Recommended Talent Prioritization**
- **Elemental Skill = Elemental Burst > Normal Attack**  

### **Talent Explanation**
Similar to Kamisato Ayato, Tartaglia's **Elemental Skill level** affects his Melee Stance Normal and Charged Attack multipliers, as well as the Riptide Slash damage. 

Elemental Burst damage is a major contributor to his overall DPS, especially when **vaporizing with a double Pyro team**. In such cases, **both Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst should be leveled equally** to level 9. 

His **Normal Attack level** affects Riptide Burst damage, which is useful in multi-target scenarios, making it worth leveling up to **level 6 (effectively level 7 with his passive talent).**

---

## **Recommended Weapons**
### **Best-in-Slot 5-Star Weapons**
- **Polar Star**  
- **Aqua Simulacra**  
- **Hunter's Path**  
- **Skyward Harp**  
- **Thundering Pulse**  
- **The First Great Magic**  

### **Alternative 4-Star Weapons**
- **Scion of the Blazing Sun**  
- **Viridescent Hunt**  

### **Other Options**
- **Stringless** (Best for Elemental Burst focus)
- **Mouun's Moon** (High Burst Damage in Vaporize teams)
- **Prototype Crescent** (Good for Charged Attack playstyle)
- **Blackcliff Warbow** (High Base ATK & CRIT DMG, but needs stacks)
- **Amos' Bow** (Decent for Charged Attack builds)

### **Not Recommended**
- **Rust** – Since Tartaglia relies on Charged Attacks for his optimal combos, Rust’s passive directly contradicts his best playstyle.
