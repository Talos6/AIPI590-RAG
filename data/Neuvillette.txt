### **Constellation**

| Name | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Honored Ordinance** | Upon entering the battlefield, Neuvillette gains a stack of "Ancient Oceanic Authority" from his passive talent. Also, when charging Heavy Attacks (Indictment Evidence & Equitable Judgment), Neuvillette gains enhanced interruption resistance. |
| **Decree of Law** | Enhances "Ancient Oceanic Authority": Each stack increases Heavy Attack (Equitable Judgment) CRIT DMG by 14%, up to 42%. Requires unlocking the passive talent "Ancient Oceanic Authority." |
| **Reconstructed Antiquity** | Increases Normal Attack skill level by 3, up to level 15. |
| **Crown of Mercy** | When Neuvillette is active on the field and receives healing, he generates 1 Hydro Droplet. Can trigger once every 4 seconds. |
| **Judgment of Justice** | Increases the skill level of "Tide, I Have Returned" by 3, up to level 15. |
| **Wrathful Recompense** | When using Heavy Attack (Equitable Judgment), Neuvillette absorbs nearby Hydro Droplets. Each absorbed Hydro Droplet extends the attack duration by 1 second. Additionally, every 2 seconds, two additional torrents are unleashed upon hitting enemies, each dealing Hydro DMG equal to 10% of Neuvillette's max HP. This damage is considered Heavy Attack damage. |

### **Recommended Artifact Sets**

| Set | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Best-in-Slot:** 4-piece Marechaussee Hunter | Ideal for boosting Neuvillette's Heavy Attack DMG. Easily stacks CRIT Rate due to HP fluctuation during Heavy Attack (Equitable Judgment). Be cautious of overcapping CRIT Rate. |
| **Alternative:** 4-piece Heart of Depth | Enhances Hydro DMG and Heavy Attack DMG after using Elemental Skill, but less effective with teammates like Furina or Kazuha. |
| **Alternative:** 4-piece Wanderer’s Troupe | Boosts Heavy Attack DMG but lacks synergy with non-Vaporize teams. |
| **Hybrid Mix:** 2-piece Nymph’s Dream + 2-piece Heart of Depth | A flexible option granting Hydro DMG bonus. |
| **Hybrid Mix:** 2-piece Tenacity of the Millelith + 2-piece Heart of Depth | Enhances HP and Hydro DMG. |

#### **Main Stats**
- **Sands:** HP%
- **Goblet:** Hydro DMG% / HP%
- **Circlet:** CRIT DMG / CRIT Rate / HP%

#### **Substats Priority**
CRIT DMG, CRIT Rate > HP% > Energy Recharge, Flat HP
