**Recommended Artifact Sets**  

- **General Build**
- **Nilou Bloom Team**
- **Charged Attack Vaporize Build**

| Artifact Set | Description |
|---|---|
| **4-piece Ocean-Hued Clam / 4-piece Tenacity of the Millelith / Mixed Set** | Ocean-Hued Clam and Maiden Beloved 2-piece effects boost Healing Bonus, while Tenacity of the Millelith 2-piece effect increases HP, both enhancing Barbara’s healing potential. |
| **Reasons for Selection** | The 4-piece bonus of Maiden Beloved improves the healing received by all team members, but its duration is only 10 seconds, whereas Barbara’s healing often lasts around 20 seconds with her level 60 passive. The Ocean-Hued Clam 4-piece effect deals physical damage based on healing done, making it useful in early-game combat. Tenacity of the Millelith's 4-piece set increases shield strength and attack power for the whole team. Barbara can trigger this with her elemental skill, but it is mainly used in specific team compositions. |

**Recommended Artifact Stats**  
- **Sands:** HP%  
- **Goblet:** HP%  
- **Circlet:** Healing Bonus  
- **Sub-stats:** HP% > CRIT Rate (for Favonius Codex) > Energy Recharge > Flat HP  

---

**Talent Priority**  
- Elemental Skill > Elemental Burst (Normal Attack upgrades are unnecessary)  
- **Reasoning:** Barbara’s Elemental Skill is her primary healing ability since it remains active while moving. Her Elemental Burst costs 80 Energy, making its uptime low, so prioritizing her Elemental Skill is more effective.

**Weapon Recommendations**  

| Weapon | Rarity | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers** | ★★★ | Best support weapon for Barbara. Provides a massive ATK buff to the next character upon swapping. |
| **Prototype Amber** | ★★★★ | Best for maximum healing. Restores Energy after using Elemental Burst and heals the entire party. |
| **Everlasting Moonglow / Jadefall’s Splendor** | ★★★★★ | Five-star options that enhance HP and Healing Bonus. |
| **Favonius Codex / Sacrificial Fragments** | ★★★★ | Good options for Energy Recharge if running frequent Elemental Bursts. |
