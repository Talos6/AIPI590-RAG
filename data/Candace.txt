- **Main Build (Support)**: Prioritize **Elemental Burst** (Skill & Normal Attacks do not need leveling)
- **Alternate Build (DPS)**: Prioritize **Elemental Burst** > **Normal Attack** > **Elemental Skill**

**Explanation**:
- Candace’s Burst provides Normal Attack buffs to teammates and is independent of its level.
- As a DPS, her Normal Attacks become infused with Hydro, so their priority is higher.
