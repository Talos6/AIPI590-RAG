### Recommended Builds

#### Artifact Sets

| Set | Recommendation |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Gilded Dreams (4-piece)** | Provides Elemental Mastery and ATK/EM boost based on party composition. Ideal when another teammate uses **Deepwood Memories**. |
| **Wanderer’s Troupe (4-piece)** | Enhances Charged Attack DMG, an effective choice for Tighnari’s playstyle. |
| **Shimenawa’s Reminiscence (4-piece)** | Increases ATK significantly, with a minor energy cost. Best if paired with good energy regeneration options. |
| **Deepwood Memories (4-piece)** | If no one in the team is using this set, Tighnari should equip it to reduce Dendro resistance. |
| **Hybrid Mix (2+2 pieces)** | Various combinations such as **2 Deepwood + 2 EM/ATK set** offer flexibility and solid damage output. |

#### Recommended Stats

| Slot | Main Stat |
|------------|----------------------|
| Sands | Elemental Mastery or ATK% |
| Goblet | Dendro DMG Bonus |
| Circlet | CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG |

**Sub-stat Priority:** CRIT Rate/CRIT DMG > Elemental Mastery/ATK% > Energy Recharge

#### Talent Priority
**Normal Attack = Elemental Burst > Elemental Skill**  
Since Tighnari’s primary damage output comes from his Charged Attacks and Elemental Burst, prioritize them equally. Elemental Skill is mainly for utility and can be upgraded last.
