| **Win the Heavens’ Favor** | When Exquisite Throw's coordinated attack activates, an additional Hydro arrow is fired, dealing Hydro DMG equal to 14% of Yelan's Max HP. This effect can occur once every 1.8s. |
| **Gambit’s Subtle Scheme** | Increases the level of Depth-Clarion Dice by 3, up to a maximum of level 15. |

| **Winner Takes All** | After using Depth-Clarion Dice, Yelan enters the "Mastermind" state: her Normal Attacks become special "Breakthrough Barbs," which function similarly to Breakthrough Barbs and deal Charged Attack DMG equivalent to 156% of a normal Breakthrough Barb's damage. This effect lasts for 20 seconds or until 5 Breakthrough Barbs are fired. |
