### Constellations

**Name** | **Effect**  
--- | ---  
**Rushing Hound: Swift as the Wind** | When a character within Gorou’s General’s War Banner or General’s Glory field deals Geo DMG to an enemy, Gorou’s Inuzaka All-Round Defense cooldown is reduced by 2s. This effect can trigger once every 10s.  
**Sitting Hound: Steady as a Clock** | During General’s Glory’s duration, when the active character in the field obtains a Crystal Shard from the Crystallize reaction, the field's duration is extended by 1s. This effect can trigger every 0.1s, up to a maximum extension of 3s.  
**Clawing Hound: Fierce as Fire** | Inuzaka All-Round Defense skill level increases by 3. Max upgrade level is 15.  
**Lapping Hound: Gentle as Water** | While General’s Glory is in effect with "Impenetrable Defense" or "Crushing Strength," it heals the active character in the field every 1.5s, restoring HP equal to 50% of Gorou’s DEF.  
**Striking Hound: Thunderous as the Raging Waves** | General’s Glory skill level increases by 3. Max upgrade level is 15.  
**Valiant Hound: Indomitable as the Mountains** | For 12s after Gorou casts Inuzaka All-Round Defense or General’s Glory, the Crit DMG of Geo DMG dealt by party members is increased based on the field’s level: “Standing Firm” increases it by 10%, “Impenetrable Defense” by 20%, and “Crushing Strength” by 40%. This effect does not stack; the most recent instance applies.

### Recommended Builds

#### **General Geo Team Support**
**Artifact Sets:**  
- 4-piece The Exile + any artifact  
- 2-piece The Exile + 2-piece Emblem of Severed Fate or Husk of Opulent Dreams + any artifact  

**Reasons for Selection:**  
Gorou’s Elemental Burst is essential for supporting teammates, and its buffs are fixed values. Therefore, Gorou only needs enough Energy Recharge, making The Exile set a great choice as it boosts his recharge and provides Energy for the team. If The Exile set is difficult to farm, a mix of The Exile and other artifacts like Emblem of Severed Fate or Husk of Opulent Dreams can also be viable.  

**Recommended Main Stats:**  
- **Sands:** Energy Recharge  
- **Goblet:** Any / DEF% (for C4 or higher)  
- **Circlet:** Crit Rate (if using Favonius Warbow) / Healing Bonus (for C4 or higher)  

**Recommended Substats:**  
- Energy Recharge, Crit Rate (if using Favonius Warbow) > DEF% (C4+), Elemental Mastery  

**Recommended Weapons:**  
- **Best:** Favonius Warbow  
- **Alternatives:** Elegy for the End, Sacrificial Bow, End of the Line, Fading Twilight
