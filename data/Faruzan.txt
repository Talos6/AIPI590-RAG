## Constellations

Faruzan’s constellation name is **Flosculi Implexi**. Each Constellation level provides the following effects:

1. **C1 – “Truth by Any Means”**  
   While under the “Manifest Gale” effect of **Wind Realm of Nasamjnin** (*Elemental Skill*), Faruzan can fire off a maximum of two Hurricane Arrows by performing fully charged Aimed Shots.

2. **C2 – “Overzealous Intellect”**  
   The duration of the Dazzling Polyhedron created by **The Wind’s Secret Ways** (*Elemental Burst*) is increased by 6s.

3. **C3 – “Spirit of Victory”**  
   Increases the Level of **Wind Realm of Nasamjnin** (*Elemental Skill*) by 3. Maximum upgrade level is 15.

4. **C4 – “Divine Comprehension”**  
   The vortex created by **Pressurized Collapse** (from Faruzan’s fully charged Hurricane Arrow) will restore Faruzan’s Elemental Energy depending on the number of enemies hit:  
   - Hitting 1 enemy restores 2 Energy.  
   - Each additional enemy hit restores an extra 0.5 Energy.  
   A single vortex can restore up to 4 Energy in this manner.

5. **C5 – “Wonderland of Rumination”**  
   Increases the Level of **The Wind’s Secret Ways** (*Elemental Burst*) by 3. Maximum upgrade level is 15.

6. **C6 – “The Wondrous Path of Truth”**  
   Characters who are under the effect of **Prayerful Wind Gift** (from Faruzan’s Elemental Burst) gain a 40% CRIT DMG bonus when dealing Anemo DMG. When the current on-field character who is affected by **Prayerful Wind Gift** deals damage, they will apply **Pressurized Collapse** to the enemy. This effect can be triggered once every 3s, shared across the entire party.

## Recommended Builds and Roles

Below are general recommendations for artifact sets, main stats, sub stats, and weapons based on Faruzan’s role in a team. She can serve as a **pure support**, a **support + sub-DPS** (especially at C6), or even a **main on-field DPS** for enthusiasts.

### I. **Pure Support (Non-C6)**
- **Suggested Artifact Sets**  
  1. **4-Piece Noblesse Oblige** (formerly translated as “Noblesse Oblige”; CN: 昔日宗室之仪)  
     - 2-Piece Bonus: +20% Elemental Burst DMG  
     - 4-Piece Bonus: Using an Elemental Burst increases all party members’ ATK by 20% for 12s.  
  2. **4-Piece The Exile** (CN: 流放者)  
     - 2-Piece Bonus: Energy Recharge +20%  
     - 4-Piece Bonus: Using an Elemental Burst regenerates 2 Energy for other party members every 2s for 6s. (Does not affect the wearer.)  
  3. **4-Piece Viridescent Venerer** (CN: 翠绿之影)  
     - 2-Piece Bonus: +15% Anemo DMG  
     - 4-Piece Bonus: +60% Swirl DMG, and it reduces the enemy’s Elemental RES to the element Swirled by 40% for 10s.  

- **Reasoning**  
  - **Noblesse Oblige (Noblesse)**: Faruzan’s Burst (**The Wind’s Secret Ways**) reduces Anemo RES by 30% and grants Anemo DMG Bonus to your team. The Noblesse 4-Piece effect adds an additional ATK% buff to further boost team DPS.  
  - **The Exile**: Useful if both Faruzan and the team desperately need more Energy (e.g., a double Anemo lineup with low Constellation Xiao). It prioritizes batterying the team, sacrificing Faruzan’s personal damage.  
  - **Viridescent Venerer**: In teams where you have significant off-field Pyro/Hydro/Electro/Cryo DMG (e.g., **Xiangling**, **Yelan**, **Furina**, etc.) and need universal Swirl shred. However, because Faruzan’s skill and Burst are somewhat front-loaded, the 4-Piece Viridescent effect may have less coverage if you use her alongside a strong Anemo DPS such as Xiao.

- **Artifact Main Stats**  
  - **Sands**: Energy Recharge%  
  - **Goblet**: Anemo DMG Bonus  
  - **Circlet**: CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG  

- **Sub Stats Priority**  
  - Energy Recharge% (until you comfortably cycle your Burst) > CRIT Rate/CRIT DMG > ATK%  

- **Talent Priority**  
  - **Only level the Elemental Burst** (Q). Faruzan’s main supportive effects (Anemo shred + Anemo DMG% buff) scale with her Burst talent level. Her personal DMG from Normal Attacks/Elemental Skill is less relevant before C6.  

- **Recommended Weapons**  
  - **Best 4★**: **Favonius Warbow**  
    - Highest Energy Recharge sub-stat among bows (up to 61.3%). Great for smoothing out Faruzan’s Energy needs and generating extra particles for the entire team.  
  - **Best 5★**: **Elegy for the End**  
    - High Base ATK (608) and a substantial ER% sub-stat (55.1%). The teamwide ATK% and Elemental Mastery buff is helpful, though the weapon effect does not further help her own ER. For non-C6 Faruzan, generally aim for at least ~260–270% ER (depending on your team comp) before using Elegy.  

  - **Other 4★ Options**:  
    - **End of the Line**, **Sacrificial Bow**, etc. — All workable if you lack Favonius Warbow, though Favonius remains the top choice for team utility due to its particle generation.  

---

### II. **Support + Sub-DPS (C6 Recommended)**

Once Faruzan unlocks **Constellation 6**, her kit gains:  
- Improved self-sustain for Energy (C4).  
- She can apply “Pressurized Collapse” passively when the on-field character attacks (C6), and that pressurized vortex counts as Elemental Skill DMG, enabling further buffs (e.g., with 4-Piece Tenacity-type sets or “千岩牢固” in Chinese).  

- **Suggested Artifact Sets**  
  1. **4-Piece Tenacity of the Millelith** (CN: 千岩牢固)  
     - 2-Piece Bonus: +20% HP  
     - 4-Piece Bonus: After Elemental Skill hits an enemy, increases party members’ ATK by 20% and their Shield Strength by 30% for 3s.  
     - *Notes*: Because Faruzan’s C6 triggers her Skill-like vortex when the on-field character hits enemies, she can reliably maintain the Tenacity 4-Piece buff. This stacks with another teammate using Noblesse.  
  2. **4-Piece Golden Troupe** (CN: 黄金剧团)  
     - 2-Piece Bonus: +20% Elemental Skill DMG  
     - 4-Piece Bonus: +25% Elemental Skill DMG; and if the character is off-field, that Skill DMG is increased by another 25%.  
     - *Notes*: A strong set if Faruzan’s personal damage is built up and you want her to deal significant off-field Skill DMG from C6 triggers.  
  3. **4-Piece Noblesse Oblige** (if no one else on the team is running it)  
  4. **4-Piece Viridescent Venerer** (if you specifically want universal RES shred for other elemental damage)  

- **Artifact Main Stats**  
  - **Sands**: ATK% or Energy Recharge% (depending on how comfortable your Burst uptime is)  
  - **Goblet**: Anemo DMG Bonus  
  - **Circlet**: CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG  

- **Sub Stats Priority**  
  - Energy Recharge% (enough for consistent Bursts) > CRIT Rate/CRIT DMG > ATK%  

- **Talent Priority**  
  - **Elemental Burst (Q) > Elemental Skill (E)**, do not level Normal Attacks.  
  - At C6, Faruzan’s Elemental Skill damage triggers more frequently, so investing in her Skill can boost sub-DPS.  

- **Recommended Weapons**  
  1. **Favonius Warbow (4★)**  
     - Still the go-to for smoothing Energy needs and generating particles for the team.  
  2. **Elegy for the End (5★)**  
     - At C6, Faruzan can easily trigger the Elegy’s “Sigil” stacks with her repeated Skill hits. High Base ATK, great ER sub-stat, and a teamwide buff.  

  - **Other 5★ Offensive Bows** (if you do not need the extra Energy):  
    - **Polar Star (Winter’s Pole)**, **Thundering Pulse (Flying Thunder)**, **The First Great Magic**, **Skyward Harp**, **Aqua Simulacra (Aqua Simulacra)**, etc.  
    - These provide higher personal DPS but less team battery potential. Once you have enough ER for comfortable rotations (often around 160%+ at C6), you can opt for more damage-oriented bows.  

---

### III. **On-Field DPS (For Fun / “Main Carry Faruzan”)**

For those who wish to keep Faruzan on field, especially post-C1 (where her Elemental Skill fires two Hurricane Arrows with each fully charged Aimed Shot), you can build her similarly to an Anemo DPS:

- **Suggested Artifact Sets**  
  - **2-Piece Viridescent Venerer + 2-Piece Golden Troupe**  
    - Or **2-Piece Viridescent Venerer + 2-Piece Gladiator’s Finale**  
    - Or **2-Piece Desert Pavilion Chronicle (“沙上楼阁史话”) + 2-Piece Gladiator’s Finale**  
  - **4-Piece Viridescent Venerer**  
    - Boosts Swirl DMG and offers universal RES shred for the team.  
  - **4-Piece Golden Troupe**  
    - High Elemental Skill DMG bonus for her repeated “Pressurized Collapse,” though it doesn’t boost Burst DMG.  

- **Artifact Main Stats**  
  - **Sands**: ATK% or Energy Recharge%  
  - **Goblet**: Anemo DMG Bonus  
  - **Circlet**: CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG  

- **Sub Stats Priority**  
  - CRIT Rate, CRIT DMG, ATK%, Energy Recharge%, Elemental Mastery (minor)  

- **Talent Priority**  
  - **Elemental Burst (Q) > Elemental Skill (E) ≥ Normal Attack**  
  - Even as a main carry, Faruzan’s Burst is still her strongest single instance of damage and crucial for her buffs. Her Normal Attacks matter only if you truly keep her on-field for Aimed Shots or standard rotations.  

- **Recommended Weapons**  
  - **5★ Best**:  
    - **Polar Star** (“Hunter’s Path,” etc.), **Aqua Simulacra**, **Skyward Harp**, **Thundering Pulse**, **The First Great Magic** – any 5★ bow offering high Base ATK and CRIT sub-stats is a strong choice.  
    - **Polar Star (aka Winter’s Pole)** is particularly potent for skill/burst-based DPS. **Aqua Simulacra** provides strong raw damage. **Skyward Harp** offers balanced CRIT Rate and CRIT DMG.  
  - **4★ Options**:  
    - **The Stringless (The Stringless)** – boosts both Skill and Burst DMG.  
    - **Prototype Crescent**, **Blackcliff Warbow**, **Mitternachts Waltz** (though Waltz is Physical-focused, which is less ideal).  
    - **Scion of the Blazing Sun (测距规)** or **Slingshot** if you want cheaper options, or **Windblume Ode** if you participated in that event.  

  - **If You Still Need ER**:  
    - **Elegy for the End** or **Favonius Warbow** remain valid for sustaining her Burst.

## Additional Notes

- Faruzan’s **Anemo DMG Bonus** and **Anemo RES Shred** from her Burst are the key points of her kit, making her an indispensable support for Anemo DPS characters such as **Xiao** or **Wanderer**.  
- At **Constellation 6**, Faruzan becomes far easier to build for both battery and damage, since her skill triggers occur on teammates’ hits and can repeatedly produce particles.  
- For “on-field DPS Faruzan,” note that her Energy demands remain high unless you invest heavily in Energy Recharge or bring a second Anemo battery.
