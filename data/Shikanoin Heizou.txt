### **Recommended Artifacts**

#### **General Sets**
- **Best DPS:** 2-piece Viridescent Venerer + 2-piece Desert Pavilion Chronicle / Gladiator’s Finale / Shimenawa’s Reminiscence / Marechaussee Hunter
- **Alternative DPS:** 4-piece Marechaussee Hunter
- **Team Support:** 4-piece Viridescent Venerer

#### **Artifact Set Reasoning**
Shikanoin Heizou functions as a quick-swap Anemo burst DPS. His artifact setup is similar to Xiao, with 2-piece Viridescent Venerer boosting his Anemo DMG by 15%. To maximize his personal damage, pairing it with 2-piece Desert Pavilion Chronicle (15% Anemo DMG), 2-piece Gladiator’s Finale (18% ATK), or 2-piece Marechaussee Hunter (20% Skill DMG) is ideal. If using the 4-piece Marechaussee Hunter set, Heizou must remain on-field to fully stack the set’s buff cycle. However, a 2+2 mix only requires 2–3 additional optimal substats to match its output. For team synergy, the 4-piece Viridescent Venerer set is preferred to reduce enemy Elemental RES for stronger elemental reactions.

#### **Main Stats**
- **Sands:** ATK%
- **Goblet:** Anemo DMG Bonus
- **Circlet:** Crit Rate / Crit DMG

#### **Substats Priority**
Crit Rate > Crit DMG > ATK% > Energy Recharge (C1–C3) > Elemental Mastery

#### **Recommended Skill Leveling**
Elemental Skill > Elemental Burst > Normal Attack

### **Recommended Weapons**

#### **Best-in-Slot 5-Star:** Kagura’s Verity
- **Reasoning:** Provides 66.2% Crit DMG at max level and boosts Elemental Skill DMG. Heizou’s 10-second cooldown on Heartstopper Strike allows him to maintain the "Kagura Dance" buff efficiently for a 12% All-Element DMG bonus.

#### **Alternative 5-Star Options:**
- **Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds:** 33.1% Crit Rate with increasing Elemental DMG over time.
- **Memory of Dust:** Boosts ATK substantially but requires shield uptime.
- **Skyward Atlas:** High base ATK and consistent Elemental DMG buff.

#### **Best 4-Star Options:**
- **Solar Pearl:** Provides high Crit Rate and enhances both Normal and Elemental Attack damage.
- **The Widsith:** Grants massive temporary buffs, but has a long cooldown.
- **Dodoco Tales:** Ideal for Heizou’s Normal Attack playstyle.
- **Blackcliff Agate:** High Crit DMG and scaling ATK bonus when defeating enemies.

#### **Weapons to Avoid:**
Weapons that do not significantly enhance Heizou’s Crit stats or Elemental Skill DMG should generally be avoided.

### **Support Heizou Build**
- **Recommended Set:** 4-piece Viridescent Venerer
- **Main Stats:** ATK% / Anemo DMG Bonus / Crit Rate or Crit DMG
- **Substats:** Crit Rate, Crit DMG, ATK%, Energy Recharge
- **Playstyle:** Functions as an off-field support by reducing enemy resistance and providing Anemo utility.

### **Conclusion**
Shikanoin Heizou is a unique Anemo catalyst user with a playstyle revolving around quick-swap combat. His effectiveness is determined by skillful execution of combos and proper artifact/weapon choices, making him a fun and viable character for both DPS and support roles.
